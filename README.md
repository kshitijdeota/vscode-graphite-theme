## Important: CSS Hacks For Extra Sweet Editor
Some things in VS Code can't be controlled by settings, but you can install [this plugin](https://github.com/be5invis/vscode-custom-css), then make a file on your computer that will hold your custom CSS, I like to make one in my root called `~/.vscodestyles.css` and then put this everything in [graphite-custom-hacks.css](./graphite-custom-hacks.css) into your file.

Once done, open your command palette and select enable **custom CSS and JS**

![Custom CSS/JS Hack](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/0B37352D3s2A2e33353c/Screen%20Shot%202017-09-15%20at%2011.02.49%20AM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=26998&v=7ff79bcc)

Finally reload your editor and the Custom CSS should be taking. You can test this by typing into file - the dirty circle should be yellow not white.

**_Note: Reloading custom CSS and JS after every VSCode update is a must!_**
